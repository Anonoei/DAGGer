# DAGGer v0.1.5a
#### Devon Adams Gordian Graphics Engine Reimagined

This is supposed to serve as an easy to use C++17 graphics/game engine.
I'm not writting the engine with the intent for other people use use,
however feel free to use, modify, and create whatever you want with it!

## Features:
  * Free and Open Source
  * Cross-platform
  * Multi-Render API (only OpenGL for now)
  * Easy-to-use API
  * Supporting a single freelance developer
